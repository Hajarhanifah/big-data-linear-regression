Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. 
The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: 
1. does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?
2.  Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?
